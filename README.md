# Bootleg Zelda game following a tutorial to learn Unity
 
I'm simply following a tutorial to learn how everything work and it is probably never gonna be released.

Here is the tutorial in question:

## What's been done so far

- 2 Tile map
- Room transition
- Room title when entering
- working colision with environment
- Interactable sign with text
- Implemented attack animation and collision
- Added destroyable object (pot)
- Added enemy moving towards you when in radius
- Knockback when running into the enemy
- Sword slash knock enemy back

## Future plan ?

I'd like to make a small game like icy tower but with added climb mechanic like bounce from one wall to the other and clamber maybe?
